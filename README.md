## About The Project

PhotoShare is a robust photo-sharing application designed to facilitate the seamless exchange of images among users. Built on the high-performance FastAPI framework, it features a RESTful API backend that provides a suite of functionalities:

- **Authentication**: Implemented via JWT tokens, supporting multiple user roles including regular users, moderators, and administrators.
- **Image Operations**: Users can upload, delete, and update image descriptions, as well as retrieve images via unique links.
- **Tagging**: Support for up to 5 unique tags per image, with existing tags reused across the application.
- **Image Transformations**: Integration with Cloudinary for advanced image operations, allowing users to transform images and generate viewable links and QR codes.
- **Commenting System**: Each image can be commented on by users, with timestamps for creation and edit, and moderation by admins.
- **User Profiles**: Users can view and edit their profiles, showcasing their activity and contributions to the platform.
- **Administration**: Extended controls for administrators, including user bans and complete CRUD capabilities over user-generated content.

The project is designed with scalability and security in mind, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence, SQLAlchemy for ORM, and following best practices for API development.
